				<h1>Recovering Fingerprints from In-Display Fingerprint Sensors via Electromagnetic Side Channel (CCS'23)</h1>
				<div class ="boxed">
					<p> 
						Recently, in-display fingerprint sensors have been widely adopted in newly-released smartphones. However, we find this new technique can leak information about the user’s fingerprints during a
						screen-unlocking process via the electromagnetic (EM) side channel that can be exploited for fingerprint recovery. We propose FPLogger to demonstrate the feasibility of this novel side-channel attack. Specifically, it leverages the emitted EM emanations whe the user presses the in-display fingerprint sensor to extract fingerprint information, then maps the captured EM signals to fingerprint images and develops 3D fingerprint pieces to spoof and unlock the smartphones.

				<h3>Public Fingerprint Dataset <a href = "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ruizgara/socofing" class="myButton">SOCOFing</a></h3>
					<div class="section">
						<div class="boxed">
							<p>
								Sokoto Coventry Fingerprint Dataset (SOCOFing) is a biometric fingerprint database designed for academic research purposes. SOCOFing contains 6,000 fingerprint images from 600 African subjects and contains unique attributes such as labels for gender, hand and finger name as well as synthetically altered versions with three different levels of alteration for obliteration, central rotation, and z-cut.

						<li class="question">
							<b> How does GhostTalk work?</b>

								<p class="answer">
									Since the shared power bank is open to rent for all users, the attackers can rent shared power banks and modify them. After modification, these malicious power banks can compromise smartphone voice assistants, and then <strong class="bold">hack private information, launch ghost call, or steal voice verification codes.</strong>
												</p>
					<b>What devices can be compromised by GhostTalk?</b>
					<p class="answer">
						New generations of smartphones have discarded 3.5mm headphone jack and integrated the headphone audio functions into the charging port. This innovation revamps the outlook of smartphones, but it imposes new threats to the smartphone audio system when users are charging in public spaces. All the smartphones with Lightning or USB-C charging ports are vulnerable to GhostTalk.
					</p>
					<b>What are the key contributions of GhostTalk?</b>
					<p class="answer">
						<ul>
								<li class="answer"> &#9733  GhostTalk can simultaneously achieve two attack goals, i.e., voice injection and eavesdropping</li>
								<li class="answer">  &#9733 GhostTalk does not require any prior knowledge about the victim's voice, and it can bypass the speaker verification through a backdoor in the charging port</li>
								<li class="answer"> &#9733  GhostTalk is resilient against strong environmental noises and can bypass liveness detection systems</li>
						</ul>

					<h2>GhostTalk-SC Attack</h2>
					<div class ="boxed">
						<p>In case when the smartphones are charged by an unaltered standard cable, we discover that it is possible to recover the audio signal from smartphone loudspeakers by monitoring the charging current on the power line.
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>To demonstrate the feasibility, we design GhostTalk-SC (Standard Cable), an adaptive eavesdropper system targeting smartphones charged in public USB ports.  To correctly recognize the private information in the audio, GhostTalk-SC carefully extracts audio spectra and integrates a neural network model to classify spoken digits in the speech. </p>
